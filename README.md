# 🤖 Autonomous Robot Development - Work in Progress

## 🎯 Project Status: ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
> *"The journey matters as much as the destination"*

## 👨‍💻 Developer
**Fernando Augusto** - Self-taught engineer from Mozambique  
Building autonomous systems with Arduino and salvaged components

## 📍 Current Phase: Research & Design
| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1. Concept Design | ✅ Complete | Initial robot vision and requirements |
| 2. Component Research | 🔄 In Progress | Finding affordable/available parts |
| 3. Circuit Design | 📅 Planned | Schematics and connections |
| 4. Initial Assembly | 📅 Planned | Physical construction |
| 5. Basic Movement | 📅 Planned | Motor control implementation |
| 6. Sensor Integration | 📅 Planned | Adding obstacle detection |
| 7. Autonomous Logic | 📅 Planned | Decision-making algorithms |

## 🎯 Project Vision
Developing an autonomous robot that demonstrates:
- **Real-time obstacle avoidance** with sensor fusion
- **Path planning** using limited computational resources
- **Adaptive behavior** through simple machine learning
- **Resource efficiency** in power and processing

## 🔧 Technical Approach
### Hardware Constraints & Solutions:

| No specialized sensors | Combining basic sensors creatively |
| Power limitations | Efficient code + sleep modes |
| No 3D printer | Cardboard/wood chassis construction |

### Planned Hardware Stack:
- **Processor:** Arduino Uno (already have)
- **Motors:** DC motors with L298N driver (to acquire)
- **Sensors:** HC-SR04 (ultrasonic) + IR sensors
- **Power:** 9V batteries or power bank
- **Chassis:** Recycled materials (plastic, cardboard)

### Software Architecture:
```
